- add event modal (forms)

- ngx-contextmenu doesn't work thru system loader, known bug #5

- show holidays (api business logic)

- fyi precision="minutes" in week view
    - but i got not times in my mock data so prob not useful

- show day event hour total instead of total events in motnh view


- displaying day view may not be needed as events prob wont have timess
    - so month and week views...
    - events have a duration value
