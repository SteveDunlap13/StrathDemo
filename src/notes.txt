- add event modal (forms)

- ngx-contextmenu doesn't work thru system loader, known bubg #5

- 


      <a addEventButton href="#" class="btn btn-primary" (click)="addEvent()">Add event</a>
      {{ day.date | calendarDate:'monthViewDayNumber':locale }}



- show holidays
- need an add event button somewhere?  or click hour in day view???
    - button seems better (outside calendar for full access)


- precision="minutes" in week view... but i got not times in my mock data

- scss files aren't forcing a broewser reload look at gulp task

- scroll to event???
- show day event hour total instead of total events
- add event is in calendar-header
    - its event needs to be fulfilled in timecard-container... how?  emit it?  event emitter?
